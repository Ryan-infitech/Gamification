# Gamification - Programming Learning

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ let's get to know my project this time: Programming Learning, a fun website for learning coding. I created this website so that friends can learn programming in a more fun and interactive way.
So, on this website, you will find fun quizzes with randomized multiple-choice questions. Not only that, you can immediately know whether your answer is correct or wrong, plus there are cute animations that make learning not boring. I use modern technologies like TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lucide React to make the appearance cool and comfortable to use.

## What can you do here?

- Choose the topic you like and start answering questions one by one
- Immediately know your score after answering
- Get a virtual trophy if you succeed
- Can be deployed directly if you want

## What makes this website special:

- The questions are randomized, so each play will get a different order
- There are animation effects that let you know immediately whether your answer is correct or wrong
- You can see how far your learning progress is
- The appearance is modern and can be used on mobile phones or laptops, plus there is a dark mode for those who like dark themes

## Technologies used:

- TypeScript - to keep the code neat and safe
- Tailwind CSS - for cool and consistent design
- Framer Motion - adding smooth animations that make your eyes happy
- Lucide React - modern icons that make the appearance even more stunning

Why should you try it? Because this website is suitable for anyone who wants to learn coding, from beginners to experts. The interface is easy to use, the design is eye-catching, and most importantly: learning becomes more fun! ðŸš€
